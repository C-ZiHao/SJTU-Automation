/*!
 * brief Demotes the cache mode of a region in the processor system bus cache.
 * This function allows the user to demote the cache mode of a region within the device's

 * region from write-back to write-through to non-cacheable.  The function checks to see
 * if the requested cache mode is higher than or equal to the current cache mode, and if
 * so, returns an error. After a region is demoted, its cache mode can only be raised
 * by a reset, which returns it to its default state which is the highest cache configure
 * for each region.
 * To maintain cache coherency, changes to the cache mode should be completed while the
 * address space being changed is not being accessed or the cache is disabled. Before a
 * cache mode change, this function completes a cache clear all command to push and invalidate any
 * cache entries that may have changed.
